5. slice the your name from string No.4
6. count number of characters in string No.5


##### Access character in the string.
    >>> 'What is my name?'[0]
    >>> 'What is my name?'[1]
    >>> 'What is my name?'[-1]

##### Concatenate string

    >>> 'What is my name?'[1:2]
    >>> 'What is my name?'[3:]
    >>> 'What is my name?'[-3:-2]
    >>> 'What is my name?'[-3:]
