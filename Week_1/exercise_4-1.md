## Python as calculator and variable number, string, and list

#### Number Operators and Number integer vs floating point.

1. enter integer (int) number in Python interactive interpreter.
2. enter floating point (float).
3. play with addition operator.

    3.1 determine the sum between 10 and 20 then check the type of the result by `type` command.
    3.2 determine the sum between 1.01 and 10 then check the type of the result.

4. play with subtraction operator.
    4.1 determine the difference between 10 and 20 then check the type of the result.
    4.2 determine the difference between 20 and 1.5 then check the type of the result.

5. play with multiplication operator.
    5.1 multiple any integer number with any integer number.
    5.2 multiple any integer number with any floating point number.
    5.3 multiple any floating point number with any floating point number.

6. play with division operator.
    6.1 change the operator from multiple to divide. (from 5.1 to 5.3)
    6.2 determine the divide any number with zero.

7. play with modulus operator.
    7.1 determine the modulus between 10 and 1.
    7.2 determine the modulus between 10 and 3.
    7.3 determine the modulus between 10 and 0.

8. play with exponentiation operator.
    8.1 change the operator from multiple to exponent. (from 5.1 to 5.3)

9. play with floor division.
    8.1 change the operator from multiple to floor division. (from 5.1 to 5.3)
