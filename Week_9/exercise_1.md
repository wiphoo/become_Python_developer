## Sorting algorithm

#### What is the bubble sort algorithm?

    # sort from lowest number to greatest number
    input_list = [5, 2, 3, 1, 8, 9, 0,]

    # after sort
    output_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9,]


#### Implementing bubble sort algorithm

    # loop over all element in the list, 
    # compare current element with next to element, 
    # repeat until no swap
